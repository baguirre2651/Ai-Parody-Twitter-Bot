# Reply Bot.py
 Created a twitter bot class top help organize code and manage shared state
   - checks how many tweets to repond to each time the program wakes up
   - using GPT 4 lanugae model with a tempature of .5 for creativity.
   - Go throughs our prompt and generate an output
   - Take a text(parent tweet (my tweet) and will generate a reponse that will then create a tweet
